To fix it in the Editor, go to Window -> Lighting -> Lightmap Tab -> Disable Continuous Baking -> Press Build to bake the lighting once manually.

Note that if you add more lights or make some changes, you have to bake the lightmap again.

Actually, Lightmapping should work in WebGL. However, realtime GI is not supported - so in your lighting setting, make sure that realtime GI is disabled before you bake.

POSSIBLE FIX: To all people who have this issue I've been trying to download something for over 2hrs, it keeps saying connecting to store, i don't need to run programs as admin, but this time i tried closing unit and then re-open with right click and run as admin, it worked very fast, let me know if it works for you.
